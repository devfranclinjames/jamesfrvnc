"I’m an extremely satisfied patient of Dr. Pham for over 21 years. I’ve enjoyed comprehensive treatment ranging from standard cleaning/exams to root canals, extractions and crowns. Never have I ever had a problem with any of her work. In fact, I relocated to Los Angeles in 2014 yet maintain my dental care with Dr. Pham, making appointments when I’m back in Reston, VA visiting family. She always accommodated my schedule.</p>
<p>Dr. Pham had the best bedside manner and professional staff of any dentist I’ve visited since childhood. I highly recommended Dr. Pham’s services. She’s the best dentist- Hands Down!"</p>

<p>"Dr. Pham provides high quality dental services, guidance, and always fully answers any questions leaving us with a comfort level that we are in good hands. Our family has been with Reston Sunrise Dentistry for over 20 years and highly recommend this practice. One of the best tips she gave our family in one of our first visits was to use a dental splint (mouthguard) nightly while sleeping. This one bit of advice has eliminated some pre-existing haw problems and night time grinding damage."</p>

<p>"I have been with Reston Sunrise Dentistry since I was a kid. Now at 20 years old, approaching 21, Dr. Pham and the office here have been so kind to me and my family over the years and have been an integral part of my life for as long as I can remember! Their practice has been great with how patient they are in order to work with patients (me being one of the kids who did not enjoy trips to the dentist). Over the years, I came to enjoy going to my dentist appointments solely because the practitioners here have essentially seen me grow up, so I find a special connection here that feels like family. Thank you so much for everything you have done over the years!"</p>

<p>"When I am at Reston Sunrise Dentistry I feel very respected, and feel that I am listened to when I am concerned. They are also very accommodating for sudden emergencies. The office is very calm and inviting, and I feel the procedures I've had have been very effective in maintaining healthy oral hygiene. And the Dr. + her associate are very kind. They are excellent w/ explaining all aspects of any procedure, and scheduling (which is extremely difficult) has been very easy since. I can text them. I would highly recommend coming here not only for excellent dentistry, but also seeing Dr. Pham + her associate's most excellent smiles!"</p>

<p>"Dr. Pham and Elizabeth have been the most caring and helpful practice I have ever been to. Dr. Pham is patient and educating as she works and always explains the process and procedures. Even after the work is done, her office always follows up to make sure everything is good. If there is an issue, they get you in immediately. Elizabeth is also patient to explain the billing and payments. This has been a big problem at other practices and here there is no surprise. She also is very responsive when you reach out. I highly recommend this practice to all."</p>

<p>"I have seen Dr.Hanah Pham for the last 23years. At an earlier time in my lifeI used to be in fear of going to a dentist appointment. Dr.Pham is an excellent dentist,she treats her patients with kindness and respect and a keen sense of ensuring that teeth care is a lifelong process. Her recommendations are always spot on and recently I have begun using a mouth guard which has made a huge difference in my ability to sleep without grinding my teeth which also has a more comfortable feeling in my jaw every day.</p>
<p>Her office environment is comforting thanks to her interest in Feng Shui. I would be remiss if I did not mention her colleague and assistant Elizabeth,who is simply a warm and kind professional in her own right .Sometimes,behind every great woman is another great woman and that is the case at Reston Sunrise Dentistry. Whether it is routine cleanings,filling cavities,root canal work ,or just taking photos(of teeth) everything is delivered in a gentle and calm manner instilling greater confidence in the overall care I receive here with Dr. Pham and Elizabeth."</p>

<p>"I first came to Dr. Pham's office several years ago, after not having visited a dentist in over 10 years. Dr. Pham &amp; Elizabeth quickly put me at ease and developed a plan to get me back on track. I couldn't be happier with their office. My daughters are also now patients. I suffered from a lot of jaw &amp; neck pain due to TMJ. Dr. Pham had a custom splint made for me which I wear every night. This has made a world of difference &amp; I am pain free in the mornings for the first time in many years. I highly recommend Dr. Pham."</p>

<p>"Reston Sunrise Dentistry is one of Reston’s hidden treasures? Designed for comfort and relaxation, Dr. Pham’s office is a welcoming space where she and her staff deliver personal care that extend well beyond curative and preventive dental medicine. At Reston Sunrise Dentistry, I found a group of dental professionals whose services are the highest quality and who invite patients to join a long term and in depth partnership. After years of subpar dental care and neglect, I had been looking for a caring and dependable dentist to help me catch up and get back on track. I am happy to have found Dr. Pham and her team."</p>

<p>"Reston Sunrise Dentistry is about 30 min from my house, and even though there are dentists much closer, I would never dream of switching. Dr. Hanah Pham and her staff are such wonderful, caring people, and they make going to the dentist an easy &amp; pleasant experience. I’m always happy with my cleanings, and would highly recommend this office to anyone who might feel intimidated about going to the dentist-they are so gentle, and offer several options if you need sedation. The office has a very calm and relaxing feel, everyone is extremely friendly &amp; accommodating &amp; Dr. Pham herself is a wonderful dentist who always answers in detail any questions I have.

<p>"I have been a regular client at Dr Hannah Pham’s office for about 6 plus years I have always found services at this clinic a good balance between quality and affordability. Plus I was very fearful at first and I had overcome the fear of dentistry with Dr. Pham gentleness and great beside manners. I could not afford sedation so Dr. Pham and staff guide me with baby steps all the way. Dr Pham us very helpful and tries to develop personal touch. She always gave the best advice to keep my teeth healthy &amp; how to prevent issues. They are very helpful with scheduling in case of last minute problems. Above all they made sure that my health &amp; gum remain in a good condition in their cases I would recommend her to anyone."</p>

<p>"I have been a patient of Dr. Pham since I moved to the suburbs, close to five years ago. A talented dentist that takes the time to explain not only the procedure, but the cause, the results and ongoing maintenance. My comfort is always at the forefront of her action and is reflected in the overall atmosphere in the office and warmth of her staff. Lets be real, no one likes going to the dentist, but this is as good and pain free as it gets."</p>

<p>"I wish to express my sincere appreciation for all the marvelous dental work and your team have provided for me. Due to poor treatments in the past, I have developed a phobia about dentistry. From the first visit I noticed a big difference in the way you and your staff made me feel at ease. You are all sensitive to my fears and take time to calm me down. Your office is a very professional and compassionate dental service and I am very happy to recommend it to anyone who wants an excellent service. Sincerely, Gladys Lopez"</p>

<p>"I found my experience with a front tooth implant to be far more pleasant than I anticipated. Dr. Pham &amp; staff showed sincere concern for my comfort and explained , in detail, the process it would take to achieve the outcome I expected. The process is a long one, but I was always “worked” into the schedule when I passed each phase and was ready to begin the next. I would recommend Dr. Pham to anyone considering a dental implant."</p>

<p>"I have had dental issues all my life. Needless to say going to the dentist wasn’t my favorite activity. I have a lot of anxiety about dentist and dental appointments. But now, it’s much easier to go to my dental appointments knowing I’m going to see Dr. Pham and Elizabeth. I’ve had a lot of dental work over the last couple years (because of my lack dental visits). Sedation dentistry was the answer for me. Dr. Pham is wonderful and caring. The quality of care is superb. If going to the dentist causes you to break out in a sweat-Go to Reston Sunrise Dentistry &amp; Dr. Pham—no more sweat just a Dry Beautiful Smile!"</p>

<p>"I am extremely pleased with all the services and work that I have done at Reston Sunrise Dentistry. I came in not having had seen a dentist in a very long time, and the staff her couldn’t have made the process easier. They were very accommodating and made sure that the primary goal would be a clean and health mouth. They’ve done a great job explaining procedures and any future preventative care. I’ve had to use their sedation service (deep IV Sedation with Dr. Tran-the anesthesiologist) for a few of the complex procedures, and it was a calm and soothing experience every time. I am very Pleased with the results; the difference in health of my mouth speaks for itself!! I would absolutely recommend Reston Sunrise Dentistry to my family and friends."</p>

<p>"I have been a patient of Dr. Hanah Pham at Sunrise Dentistry for many years. Dr. Pham has been great about addressing my questions and educating me on the best practices in dental care. She and the rest of her staff are always welcoming and proactive about my dental care and very patient with my concerns. I feel confident that their care is top notch and I appreciate their focus on preventative care. For example, in the last year, Dr. Pham created a night guard for me when she noticed signs that I was grinding my teeth at night. Hopefully, this will eliminate any risk of cracked teeth due to grinding in the future."</p>
